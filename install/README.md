This folder holds a binary of the current SID firmware, ready for upload to your device.

For installation instructions, see [here](../README.md#installation).

Note: As of version 1.70, the internally used file format for secondary and IP settings was changed. Version 1.70 will automatically update old files to the new format, later versions will not. If you intend to update from a version below 1.70 to a version above 1.70, please install [version 1.70](https://github.com/realA10001986/SID/releases/tag/V1.70) as an intermediate to have your secondary and IP settings converted.
