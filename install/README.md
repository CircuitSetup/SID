This folder holds all files necessary for immediate installation on your Flux Capacitor. Here you'll find a binary of the current firmware, ready for upload to the device.

## Firmware Installation

If a previous version of the SID firmware is installed on your device, you can update easily using the pre-compiled binary. Enter the Config Portal, click on "Update" and select the pre-compiled binary file provided in this repository ([install/sid-A10001986.ino.nodemcu-32s.bin](https://github.com/realA10001986/SID/blob/main/install/sid-A10001986.ino.nodemcu-32s.bin)).

If you are using a fresh ESP32 board, please see [sid-A10001986.ino](https://github.com/realA10001986/SID/blob/main/sid-A10001986/sid-A10001986.ino) for detailed build and upload information, or, if you don't want to deal with source code, compilers and all that nerd stuff, go [here](https://install.out-a-ti.me) and follow the instructions.

 *Important: After a firmware update, a "wait" symbol (hourglass) might be shown for a short while after reboot. Do NOT unplug the device during this time.*
